This is a resubmission. Compared to the last version:

* The description now has "moved its own package" instead of 
  "movied its own package" even though the flip was very apropos ;)


## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.1
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.2.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

* This is a new package
